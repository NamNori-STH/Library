## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) centrally manages all relationships with third parties, including vendors, contractors, and business associates. By consolidating vendor oversight at the parent level, STH ensures consistent application of security, compliance, and contractual safeguards across all subsidiaries. This centralization reduces duplication, ensures visibility into third party risks, and strengthens enterprise-wide protection of sensitive data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI).  

This policy establishes the **enterprise-wide requirements for third party management**. Subsidiaries may only manage vendor relationships directly in exceptional cases authorized by Summit leadership, and such cases must still comply with this policy.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all vendors and third parties providing products or services to Summit Technology Holdings or its subsidiaries. Vendors fall into scope if they meet one or more of the following criteria:  

1. **Critical to operations** – The loss of service would cause significant disruption to Summit or subsidiary business functions.  
2. **Access to sensitive data** – The vendor either directly accesses sensitive data in Summit’s possession or Summit provides sensitive data to them.  
3. **Access to internal systems/networks** – The vendor has physical or remote access to internal systems and networks, or there is a direct network connection established between them and Summit.  

The policy covers both new engagements and the ongoing management of existing vendor relationships.

## 3. Vendor Inventory & Classification

STH will maintain a centralized inventory of all third parties engaged across the enterprise. Vendors will be classified according to the criteria in Section 2 (criticality, access to sensitive data, or access to internal systems/networks). Higher-risk vendors will be subject to stricter onboarding requirements, more frequent reviews, and heightened monitoring. Subsidiaries are responsible for notifying STH of new vendor needs or changes so that vendors may be inventoried and assessed appropriately.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-01 (*Inventory of Third Parties*).  

---

## 4. Risk Assessment of Vendors

STH will conduct security and risk assessments of all vendors that meet the applicability criteria before contracts are executed. Assessments will evaluate the vendor’s security posture, ability to protect sensitive data, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA, SOC 2). Vendors classified as critical, sensitive-data handlers, or network/system integrators will receive higher levels of due diligence. Risk assessments will be repeated periodically based on vendor classification. Subsidiaries must cooperate with STH’s information gathering efforts but will not conduct assessments independently.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-02 (*Third Party Risk Assessments*).  

---

## 5. Contracts and Business Associate Agreements

All vendor contracts will be negotiated, reviewed, and executed under the authority of Summit Technology Holdings. Contracts involving access to sensitive data must include appropriate data protection clauses, right-to-audit provisions, breach notification obligations, and, where required by HIPAA, Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). Subsidiaries must not engage vendors outside of STH’s contracting process except by explicit written approval from Summit leadership.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-04 (*Third Party Contracts*).  

---

## 6. Monitoring and Oversight

STH will oversee all vendors through periodic monitoring and due diligence reviews. The level of monitoring will be proportionate to vendor classification (critical, sensitive-data, network/system access). Monitoring may include SOC 2 Type II reports, HIPAA attestations, penetration test results, and security questionnaires. Subsidiaries must escalate any vendor-related performance or security concerns to STH immediately for investigation and resolution.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-05 (*Third Party Monitoring*).  

---

## 7. Termination of Vendor Relationships

When a vendor relationship ends, STH is responsible for ensuring that all access to systems, data, and facilities is revoked. Vendors must return or securely destroy Summit-owned or subsidiary-owned data, with certification of destruction provided as evidence. Contract closure activities must be documented and reviewed by management. Subsidiaries must not manage vendor termination independently, but must coordinate with STH to ensure proper disengagement.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-08 (*Termination of Third Party Relationships*).  

---

## 8. Subsidiary Participation

Subsidiaries are expected to:  

- Submit requests for new vendors through STH’s procurement and vendor risk management process.  
- Provide justification, requirements, and context for vendor engagements.  
- Cooperate with risk assessments, contract reviews, and monitoring requests.  
- Report concerns with vendor performance or compliance to STH promptly.  

Subsidiaries must not bypass or duplicate vendor management activities unless explicitly approved by Summit leadership.  

---

## 9. Compliance & Governance

- STH will maintain evidence of vendor inventories, risk assessments, contracts, monitoring results, and termination certifications.  
- The STH Security and Compliance teams will conduct periodic audits of vendor management processes.  
- Non-compliance with this policy will result in remediation actions and may trigger escalation to executive management.  

---

## 10. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. Summit Technology Holdings reserves the right to restrict or terminate vendor access at any time to protect its systems and data.
