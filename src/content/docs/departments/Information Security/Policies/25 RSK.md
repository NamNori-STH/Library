## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) is committed to identifying, evaluating, and managing risks that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and data. This policy establishes enterprise-wide requirements for risk management, while subsidiaries are responsible for developing standards and processes that align with these directives.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all subsidiaries, systems, business units, and third parties acting on behalf of STH. It includes risks to regulated data such as electronic protected health information (ePHI), personally identifiable information (PII), and financial data, as well as broader operational, regulatory, and reputational risks.  

---

## 3. Risk Management Program

STH requires each subsidiary to implement a documented risk management program that integrates with enterprise oversight. Programs must define roles and responsibilities, establish governance structures, and be resourced adequately to ensure risks are continuously identified and managed.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-01 (*Risk Management Program*)  

---

## 4. Risk Identification

Subsidiaries must actively identify risks across their technology environments, operations, and vendors. Identification processes must capture threats, vulnerabilities, and business impacts, and results must be documented in a manner that supports further analysis.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-03 (*Risk Identification*)  

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

Risk assessments must be conducted at least annually and after significant system or process changes. Assessments must evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks, document mitigating controls, and record results in a risk register.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-04 (*Risk Assessment*)  

---

## 6. Risk Ranking

Risks must be ranked to prioritize remediation and resource allocation. Ranking must consider severity, potential regulatory impact, and business criticality. High and critical risks must be reported to STH management for oversight.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-05 (*Risk Ranking*)  

---

## 7. Risk Remediation

Subsidiaries must establish and execute remediation plans for identified risks. Remediation efforts must be tracked, assigned to responsible parties, and validated after completion. Where risks cannot be fully remediated, compensating controls or alternative treatments must be documented.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-06 (*Risk Remediation*)  

---

## 8. Risk Assessment Updates

Risk assessments must be updated periodically, including when new systems are introduced, significant changes occur, or new threats emerge. Updates must ensure the enterprise maintains an accurate understanding of the current risk environment.  

- **SCF Mapping:** RSK-07 (*Risk Assessment Update*)  

---

## 9. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of risk assessments, risk registers, and remediation actions.  
- STH will review and monitor risk management activities for alignment with enterprise requirements.  
- Non-compliance must be remediated promptly, with escalations to executive leadership as needed.  

---

## 10. Enforcement

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, suspension of access, termination of employment or contracts, or other corrective actions.
