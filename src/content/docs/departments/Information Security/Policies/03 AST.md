**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Scope:** All subsidiaries and affiliates (e.g., FrontRunnerHC, Inc. and LabXChange, LLC)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Asset Management (AST)

**Subsidiary References:**  

- Not applicable – asset management is centralized at Summit Technology Holdings, LLC.

---

## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) centrally manages and governs all information system assets across the enterprise. Effective asset management ensures accountability, reduces risk, and provides the foundation for security, compliance, and operational resilience.  

This policy establishes enterprise-wide requirements for identifying, classifying, and controlling assets. Subsidiaries must cooperate with STH by reporting changes, but do not maintain independent asset management programs.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all assets owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by STH, including:  

- Hardware (servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, networking equipment, storage systems).  
- Software (operating systems, applications, databases, middleware, licenses).  
- Cloud resources (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS subscriptions, containers, storage).  
- Data-bearing media and peripherals.  

---

## 3. Asset Governance

STH will maintain governance processes that define policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities for asset management. These processes will cover the entire lifecycle of assets, from acquisition through disposal, and will include inventories, diagrams, and return requirements. Governance activities will be reviewed at least annually.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-01 (*Asset Governance*)  

---

## 4. Asset Inventories

STH will maintain a complete and accurate inventory of all assets. The inventory must include ownership, location, classification, and unique identifiers. Automated discovery and manual updates must be used to ensure accuracy. Inventory reviews will be conducted on a defined cadence.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-02 (*Asset Inventories*)  

---

## 5. Asset Ownership Assignment

Every asset must have an assigned owner who is accountable for its use, security, and lifecycle management. Ownership will be documented in the centralized inventory and reviewed whenever changes occur.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-03 (*Asset Ownership Assignment*)  

---

## 6. Network Diagrams & Data Flow Diagrams

Each subsidiary is responsible for maintaining up-to-date network diagrams and data flow diagrams (DFDs) that document their local environments, trust boundaries, and movement of sensitive data such as ePHI. STH will establish enterprise standards for diagram formats and content, while subsidiaries must ensure diagrams are kept current and submitted to STH for central governance and risk management purposes.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-04 (*Network Diagrams & Data Flow Diagrams*)  

---

## 7. Secure Disposal, Destruction or Re-Use of Equipment

STH will ensure that all data-bearing assets are securely sanitized or destroyed before disposal or re-use. Subsidiaries must coordinate all asset retirements through STH. Detailed requirements for data sanitization and disposal processes are further defined in the **Data Classification & Handling Policy**, which governs disposal in alignment with SCF’s broader Data Classification & Handling (DCH) controls.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-09 (*Secure Disposal, Destruction or Re-Use of Equipment*)  

---

## 8. Return of Assets

All assets must be returned to STH upon employee termination, role change, or contract completion. STH IT and HR will coordinate the collection and verification of returned assets. Failure to return assets will be escalated and may result in disciplinary or legal action.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AST-10 (*Return of Assets*)  

---

## 9. Compliance & Governance

- STH will maintain evidence of inventories, ownership records, diagrams, destruction certificates, and asset return logs.  
- Subsidiaries must promptly notify STH of any asset changes.  
- Regular reviews will be conducted to validate compliance with this policy.  

---

## 10. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. STH reserves the right to disable, quarantine, or repossess any asset that does not comply with enterprise requirements.
