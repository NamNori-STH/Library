**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Scope:** All subsidiaries and affiliates (e.g., FrontRunnerHC, Inc. and LabXChange, LLC)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCD)

## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires each subsidiary to maintain the ability to continue critical operations during and after disruptive events. While subsidiaries are responsible for developing, maintaining, and testing their own Business Continuity Plans (BCPs), Summit provides **oversight, governance, and enterprise alignment** to ensure consistency across the organization.  

This policy establishes the **enterprise-wide business continuity requirements** that all subsidiaries must follow, ensuring that subsidiary-specific plans are integrated into the overall continuity framework of Summit Technology Holdings.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all subsidiaries, business units, information systems, applications, personnel, and facilities required to maintain continuity of essential services. It also applies to third parties supporting critical operations where continuity obligations are contractually enforced.  

---

## 3. Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)

Each subsidiary must develop and manage its own BCP in accordance with Summit’s BCMS framework. The BCMS provides governance, enterprise requirements, and oversight for subsidiary planning efforts. Subsidiaries must ensure their BCPs address recovery time objectives (RTOs), recovery point objectives (RPOs), dependencies, and communications protocols consistent with Summit standards.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-01 (*Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)*)  

---

## 4. Identify Critical Assets

Subsidiaries must identify essential missions, business functions, critical assets, and dependencies (people, facilities, vendors, technology). This information must be documented in subsidiary BCPs and reported to Summit to support enterprise-level visibility and risk management.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-02 (*Identify Critical Assets*)  

---

## 5. Contingency Training

Subsidiaries must ensure personnel with business continuity roles receive training specific to their responsibilities. Training must include simulations or table-top exercises appropriate to their operations. Summit will review and validate that training programs are in place.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-03 (*Contingency Training*)  

---

## 6. Contingency Plan Testing & Exercises

Each subsidiary must test its BCP at least annually. Tests may include functional exercises, simulations, or failover validations. Summit will provide oversight, require documentation of test results, and ensure corrective actions are implemented.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-04 (*Contingency Plan Testing & Exercises*)  

---

## 7. Root Cause Analysis & Lessons Learned

Subsidiaries must conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and capture lessons learned following any real-world disruption or test. Corrective actions must be documented and tracked to closure. Summit will oversee RCA outcomes to ensure systemic issues are addressed.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-05 (*Contingency Plan Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Lessons Learned*)  

---

## 8. Ongoing Contingency Planning

Subsidiary BCPs must be updated regularly to reflect organizational or technology changes, emerging risks, and lessons learned. Summit will review plans periodically to ensure updates meet enterprise governance requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-06 (*Ongoing Contingency Planning*)  

---

## 9. Alternate Storage Site

Subsidiaries that maintain or process critical data must ensure it is replicated or backed up to alternate storage locations with appropriate separation from the primary site. Summit will validate that subsidiary implementations align with enterprise requirements for data protection.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-08 (*Alternate Storage Site*)  

---

## 10. Alternate Processing Site

Where required, subsidiaries must identify and maintain alternate processing capabilities (e.g., secondary data centers, cloud regions) to support recovery of critical operations. Summit will provide oversight to ensure alternate sites are tested and meet security requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-09 (*Alternate Processing Site*)  

---

## 11. Telecommunications Services Availability

Subsidiaries must ensure telecommunications services are resilient, with diversity of providers and alternate communication channels where feasible. Summit will monitor that telecommunications plans align with enterprise availability expectations.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-10 (*Telecommunications Services Availability*)  

---

## 12. Data Backups

Subsidiaries must define and execute backup strategies for their systems in alignment with Summit’s enterprise backup requirements. Backups must be encrypted, tested for integrity, and retained per regulatory and business requirements. Summit will review backup strategies and test outcomes.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-11 (*Data Backups*)  

---

## 13. Information System Recovery & Reconstitution

Subsidiaries must ensure their systems can be recovered and reconstituted within required timeframes, including transaction recovery and failover capabilities. Summit will oversee recovery objectives and validate that system-level plans meet enterprise resiliency requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** BCD-12 (*Information System Recovery & Reconstitution*)  

---

## 14. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of BIAs, risk assessments, continuity plans, training, and test results.  
- Summit will conduct oversight reviews and audits of subsidiary continuity planning.  
- Non-compliance with this policy will result in remediation requirements and may trigger escalation to executive leadership.  

---

## 15. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. Summit Technology Holdings may take immediate action to protect enterprise operations during disruptions.
