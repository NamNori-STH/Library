## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that each subsidiary conduct capacity and performance planning to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data. Proactive monitoring and planning reduce the risk of outages, support compliance, and ensure scalability.  

This policy establishes the **enterprise-wide baseline requirements**, while each subsidiary is responsible for managing and documenting how these requirements are implemented for their own applications and environments.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all information systems, applications, databases, infrastructure, and cloud services owned or operated by STH subsidiaries. It also applies to third-party hosted environments where subsidiaries process or store sensitive information, including electronic protected health information (ePHI).  

---

## 3. Capacity & Performance Management

Each subsidiary must establish processes for monitoring and managing capacity and performance within its environment. These processes must include defining baseline expectations, identifying critical services, and implementing escalation procedures when thresholds are exceeded. Subsidiaries must provide reporting to STH on capacity and performance status upon request.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CAP-01 (*Capacity & Performance Management*)  

---

## 4. Resource Priority

Each subsidiary must identify business-critical applications and systems, including those supporting ePHI, financial reporting, or regulated workloads. During times of constrained resources, these critical services must be prioritized over less essential workloads, consistent with enterprise priorities defined by STH.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CAP-02 (*Resource Priority*)  

---

## 5. Capacity Planning

Each subsidiary must conduct forward-looking capacity planning to anticipate growth, seasonal demand, or new projects. Plans must ensure adequate resources are available to support business needs under both normal and peak loads. Material changes or risks identified during planning must be reported to STH for review and oversight.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CAP-03 (*Capacity Planning*)  

---

## 6. Performance Monitoring

Each subsidiary must implement continuous monitoring of system performance to detect anomalies, degradation, and potential bottlenecks. Metrics must be collected, analyzed, and retained. Monitoring results must be incorporated into capacity planning activities and made available to STH for compliance oversight.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CAP-04 (*Performance Monitoring*)  

---

## 7. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of performance baselines, monitoring results, capacity forecasts, and resource prioritization plans.  
- STH Security and Compliance will review subsidiary practices to ensure they align with this policy.  
- Deficiencies must be remediated within defined timelines.  

---

## 8. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. STH reserves the right to direct remediation activities or reallocate resources where capacity or performance risks threaten enterprise operations.
