## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that changes to information systems be controlled, documented, and communicated to reduce risk and maintain compliance with regulatory obligations. This policy establishes enterprise-wide requirements, while **each subsidiary manages its own changes** through local procedures and systems.

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all changes made to information systems, applications, infrastructure, cloud services, and configurations managed by subsidiaries of STH. Each subsidiary is responsible for ensuring that its change processes align with this policy.

## 3. Change Management Program

Each subsidiary must implement and maintain a documented change management program. The program must ensure that all changes are requested, documented, reviewed, approved, and tracked through closure. Local processes may be tailored to subsidiary environments but must align with this enterprise policy.

## 5. Stakeholder Notification of Changes
