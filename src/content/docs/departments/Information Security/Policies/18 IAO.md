## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) maintains an information assurance program that ensures systems and services are trustworthy, resilient, and compliant with regulatory requirements. Information assurance provides confidence that data and systems operate as intended, and that security safeguards are effective and verifiable.  

This policy establishes the enterprise-wide requirements for information assurance, while subsidiaries are responsible for implementing standards and procedures that align with these requirements.

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all STH subsidiaries, systems, applications, and services that process, store, or transmit sensitive or regulated data. It extends to third parties that operate under contract with STH or its subsidiaries and that have access to enterprise information assets.

## 3. Information Assurance Operations

STH requires subsidiaries to implement information assurance (IA) operations that integrate security, availability, integrity, and resilience into all systems and services. IA operations must be documented, regularly reviewed, and embedded into system lifecycle management.

## 4. Assessments

Subsidiaries must conduct periodic assessments to verify that controls are implemented and effective. These assessments may include internal reviews, independent audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing. Assessment results must be documented, tracked, and remediated.  

Assessments must be repeated at regular intervals, after significant system changes, or following major incidents to ensure that assurance objectives remain valid.
