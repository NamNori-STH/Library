## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) is committed to ensuring effective detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery from cybersecurity incidents. A coordinated incident response capability ensures that security events are handled in a timely, consistent, and legally defensible manner, while minimizing disruption to business operations. This policy establishes enterprise-level incident response requirements, with subsidiaries responsible for implementing local standards and procedures aligned with these directives.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all STH subsidiaries, employees, contractors, systems, networks, and applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive or regulated data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI).  

---

## 3. Incident Response Operations

STH requires subsidiaries to establish documented incident response operations capable of detecting, analyzing, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. These operations must be formally approved, regularly maintained, and integrated into broader business continuity and disaster recovery processes.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-01 (*Incident Response Operations*)  

---

## 4. Incident Handling

Subsidiaries must follow a structured process for handling incidents, including detection, reporting, triage, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review. The process must clearly define roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and communication protocols.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-02 (*Incident Handling*)  

---

## 5. Incident Response Plan (IRP)

Each subsidiary must maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) aligned with this policy. The IRP must define procedures for various incident types, identify responsible personnel, and include communication and escalation requirements. Plans must be reviewed and updated at least annually or following a significant incident.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-04 (*Incident Response Plan (IRP)*)  

---

## 6. Incident Response Testing

Subsidiaries must test their IRPs on at least an annual basis through tabletop exercises, simulations, or live tests. Testing ensures personnel are familiar with their roles, plans remain current, and gaps are identified for remediation.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-06 (*Incident Response Testing*)  

---

## 7. Integrated Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)

Subsidiaries must maintain a Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) or equivalent capability that integrates with STH’s governance and oversight. The SIRT must include clearly assigned roles and provide cross-functional representation, including IT, security, legal, and compliance.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-07 (*Integrated Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)*)  

---

## 8. Chain of Custody & Forensics

Subsidiaries must preserve evidence through appropriate forensic practices, including documentation of chain of custody for digital and physical evidence. Evidence must be collected in a manner that is admissible in legal or regulatory proceedings.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-08 (*Chain of Custody & Forensics*)  

---

## 9. Situational Awareness for Incidents

Subsidiaries must maintain situational awareness of incident activity through continuous monitoring, alerting, and information-sharing with STH. Lessons learned from external threat intelligence and industry sources must be incorporated into incident response procedures.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-09 (*Situational Awareness for Incidents*)  

---

## 10. Incident Stakeholder Reporting

All incidents must be reported to appropriate stakeholders in a timely manner. Internal notifications must escalate through security and executive leadership, while external notifications (e.g., regulators, partners, customers) must follow legal and contractual requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-10 (*Incident Stakeholder Reporting*)  

---

## 11. Root Cause Analysis & Lessons Learned

Following each major incident, subsidiaries must perform a root cause analysis (RCA) to identify contributing factors and corrective actions. Lessons learned must be incorporated into improved processes, updated playbooks, and revised training.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-13 (*Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Lessons Learned*)  

---

## 12. Regulatory & Law Enforcement Contacts

STH will maintain formal points of contact with regulatory authorities and law enforcement. Subsidiaries must escalate incidents with potential legal, criminal, or regulatory impact to STH for coordinated response and disclosure.  

- **SCF Mapping:** IRO-14 (*Regulatory & Law Enforcement Contacts*)  

---

## 13. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must retain incident records, IRP documentation, testing evidence, and RCA reports.  
- STH will periodically review subsidiary IRPs and incident response activities to ensure alignment with enterprise requirements.  
- Non-compliance with this policy must be remediated promptly.  

---

## 14. Enforcement

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, suspension of system access, or termination of employment or contracts. STH reserves the right to assume control of incident response activities when necessary to protect enterprise operations.
