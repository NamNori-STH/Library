## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that all use of cloud services be governed by enterprise-wide security requirements. Proper cloud security ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI), while maintaining compliance with regulatory obligations such as HIPAA and SOC 2.  

This policy establishes the baseline requirements for cloud adoption, use, and oversight across all subsidiaries.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and hybrid) that are used by STH or its subsidiaries, whether directly contracted or indirectly consumed via third-party vendors. It applies to production and non-production environments where sensitive data or regulated workloads are stored, processed, or transmitted.  

---

## 3. Cloud Services

All use of cloud services must be reviewed and approved by STH before onboarding. Subsidiaries must conduct risk assessments to ensure that security, compliance, and contractual requirements are met. Offboarding processes must include secure data transfer or deletion, revocation of access, and termination of billing.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CLD-01 (*Cloud Services*)  

---

## 4. Geolocation Requirements for Processing, Storage & Services

Subsidiaries must ensure that sensitive data (including ePHI and financial information) is processed, stored, and transmitted only within approved geographic regions. Cloud service providers (CSPs) must disclose data residency and replication practices, and subsidiaries must configure services to comply with Summit’s geolocation requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CLD-09 (*Geolocation Requirements for Processing, Storage & Services*)  

---

## 5. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)

Each subsidiary must implement and maintain a **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)** or equivalent security control for their cloud environments. The CASB capability must provide visibility into cloud usage, enforce policy controls, detect shadow IT, and generate reports for compliance purposes. STH will oversee the consistency of CASB implementation across subsidiaries to ensure enterprise-wide coverage.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CLD-11 (*Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)*)  

---

## 6. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of cloud service approvals, risk assessments, geolocation configurations, and CASB reports.  
- STH will review subsidiary cloud usage to ensure alignment with enterprise cloud security requirements.  
- Non-compliance must be remediated within defined timelines and may be escalated to executive leadership.  

---

## 7. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, suspension of contracts, or legal action depending on severity. STH reserves the right to suspend or terminate use of cloud services that do not meet enterprise requirements.
