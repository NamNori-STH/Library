title: Configuration Management
---

**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Scope:** All subsidiaries and affiliates (e.g., FrontRunnerHC, Inc. and LabXChange, LLC)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Configuration Management (CFG)

**Subsidiary References:**  

- LabXChange, LLC – Configuration Management Standard *(to be published)*  
- FrontRunnerHC, Inc – Configuration Management Standard *(to be published)*

## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that subsidiaries implement and maintain strong configuration management practices to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, unauthorized changes, and service disruptions.  

This policy defines the enterprise-wide requirements for configuration management, while subsidiaries are responsible for implementing detailed standards and controls within their environments.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all systems, applications, cloud services, and infrastructure components managed by STH subsidiaries. It applies equally to production, staging, and development environments where sensitive or regulated data (including ePHI) is processed, stored, or transmitted.  

---

## 3. Configuration Management Program

Each subsidiary must establish a documented configuration management program that defines roles, responsibilities, processes, and tools for managing configurations throughout the system lifecycle.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-01 (*Configuration Management Program*)  

---

## 4. System Hardening Through Baseline Configurations

All systems must be deployed using hardened baseline configurations aligned with industry best practices (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs). Baseline configurations must be documented, approved, and periodically reviewed. Deviations must be explicitly approved and tracked.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-02 (*System Hardening Through Baseline Configurations*)  

---

## 5. Least Functionality

Subsidiaries must configure systems and applications to provide only essential capabilities. Unnecessary services, ports, protocols, and applications must be disabled or removed. Regular reviews must verify adherence to least functionality principles.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-03 (*Least Functionality*)  

---

## 6. Software Usage Restrictions

Subsidiaries must enforce software usage restrictions to prevent the use of unauthorized or unlicensed software. Open-source components must be reviewed for licensing and security risks. Unsupported browsers, email clients, or software are prohibited in production environments.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-04 (*Software Usage Restrictions*)  

---

## 7. User-Installed Software

End-users must not install software on systems without explicit approval. Subsidiaries must enforce technical controls to restrict software installation rights to authorized administrators and must monitor for unauthorized installations.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-05 (*User-Installed Software*)  

---

## 8. Configuration Enforcement

Subsidiaries must use automated tools and centralized management platforms where possible to enforce configuration standards. Unauthorized changes must be detected, logged, and remediated promptly. Configuration integrity must be validated regularly.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-06 (*Configuration Enforcement*)  

---

## 9. Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP)

Where supported, subsidiaries must use zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) technologies to ensure secure, consistent, and efficient deployment of devices and systems. ZTP implementations must be protected against unauthorized manipulation.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-07 (*Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP)*)  

---

## 10. Sensitive / Regulated Data Access Enforcement

Systems that store or process sensitive or regulated data (including ePHI and PII) must enforce configuration settings that restrict and monitor access. These settings must prevent unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of sensitive data.  

- **SCF Mapping:** CFG-08 (*Sensitive / Regulated Data Access Enforcement*)  

---

## 11. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of baseline configurations, hardening standards, enforcement logs, and configuration reviews.  
- STH will periodically review subsidiary configuration management programs for consistency with this policy.  
- Deficiencies must be remediated within defined timelines.  

---

## 12. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. STH reserves the right to restrict or revoke system access where non-compliant configurations pose risk to enterprise security.
