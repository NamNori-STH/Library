## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and other autonomous technologies be governed responsibly and safely. This policy establishes enterprise-wide requirements to manage risk, uphold accountability, and ensure compliance when these technologies support business operations or regulated workloads.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all AI/ML/autonomous technologies developed, acquired, or deployed by STH or its subsidiaries, including internal builds, third-party tools, SaaS features, and embedded capabilities in platforms or devices.  

---

## 3. AI & Autonomous Technologies Governance

STH will establish and maintain governance processes for AI and autonomous technologies. Subsidiaries must:  

- Identify all proposed and in-use AI/AAT use cases.  
- Designate accountable owners.  
- Conduct risk assessments prior to production use and upon material change.  
- Ensure compliance with legal, security, safety, and privacy requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AAT-01 (*Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Autonomous Technologies Governance*)  

---

## 4. Situational Awareness of AI & Autonomous Technologies

STH and subsidiaries must maintain an up-to-date inventory of AI/AAT systems—including purpose, data types (e.g., ePHI, PII), providers, hosting location, owners, risk tier, and lifecycle status. The inventory must be reconciled on a defined cadence and used for risk management, monitoring, and decommissioning.  

- **SCF Mapping:** AAT-02 (*Situational Awareness of AI & Autonomous Technologies*)  

---

## 5. Compliance & Governance

- Evidence must be maintained (e.g., risk assessments, use-case approvals, inventories).  
- STH Security and Compliance will perform periodic reviews of AI/AAT governance and inventories.  
- Gaps must be remediated within defined timelines.  

---

## 6. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. STH reserves the right to disable or decommission any AI/AAT systems that fail to meet enterprise governance requirements.
