## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) is responsible for the enterprise-wide collection, analysis, and distribution of threat intelligence. By centralizing this function, STH ensures consistency, quality, and coordinated response across all subsidiaries. This policy establishes how STH provides threat intelligence services and defines the responsibilities of subsidiaries in consuming and applying those services.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all STH subsidiaries, employees, contractors, and third parties who rely on threat intelligence for monitoring, detection, or incident response activities. Subsidiaries are required to act on threat intelligence provided by STH to strengthen defenses and mitigate risks within their own environments.  

---

## 3. Threat Intelligence Program

STH maintains the enterprise Threat Intelligence Program, which is responsible for collecting data from trusted government, industry, vendor, and open-source sources. STH validates, correlates, and disseminates relevant threat information to subsidiaries. Subsidiaries must integrate this intelligence into their local monitoring, detection, and risk management processes.  

- **SCF Mapping:** THR-01 (*Threat Intelligence Program*)

## 4. Threat Intelligence Feeds

STH centrally subscribes to and manages all enterprise threat intelligence feeds. Intelligence from these feeds is analyzed by STH and distributed to subsidiaries in the form of alerts, advisories, and recommended defensive measures. Subsidiaries are required to implement these defensive measures in their environments.  

- **SCF Mapping:** THR-03 (*Threat Intelligence Feeds*)

## 5. Threat Catalog

STH maintains access to actively maintained **third-party threat catalogs** provided by trusted intelligence vendors and industry sources. These catalogs include threat actor profiles, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and are continuously updated. STH curates and shares relevant information with subsidiaries, who must review and apply updates relevant to their operational environments.  


- **SCF Mapping:** THR-09 (*Threat Catalog*)

## 6. Threat Analysis

STH performs enterprise-level threat analysis to identify trends, prioritize defensive strategies, and inform risk management activities. The results of this analysis are communicated to subsidiaries, who are responsible for integrating recommendations into their local processes, including incident response and vulnerability management.  

- **SCF Mapping:** THR-10 (*Threat Analysis*)  

---

## 7. Compliance & Governance

- STH will maintain evidence of subscribed threat feeds, the enterprise threat catalog, and analysis activities.  
- Subsidiaries must demonstrate that they have implemented recommended mitigations or compensating controls based on STH-provided intelligence.  
- Non-compliance by subsidiaries must be remediated promptly, with escalation to STH executive leadership as necessary.  

---

## 8. Enforcement

Failure by subsidiaries to apply or act upon intelligence provided by STH may result in disciplinary action, suspension of system access, or contract termination. STH reserves the right to audit subsidiary environments for adherence to threat management requirements.
