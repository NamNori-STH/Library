## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) requires that all data, including sensitive and regulated information such as electronic protected health information (ePHI), personally identifiable information (PII), and financial data, be classified, protected, and handled in accordance with enterprise standards.  

This policy defines the baseline requirements for data classification, labeling, protection, retention, and secure disposal. Subsidiaries must implement detailed standards and procedures that align with these enterprise requirements.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all forms of data created, processed, stored, or transmitted by STH and its subsidiaries, regardless of format (electronic or physical) or location (on-premises, cloud, or third-party hosted).  

---

## 3. Data Protection

All sensitive or regulated data must be identified, protected, and handled in accordance with applicable regulatory and contractual obligations. Subsidiaries must implement controls to ensure data is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-01 (*Data Protection*)  

---

## 4. Data & Asset Classification

STH will maintain a data classification scheme that defines categories such as Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Subsidiaries must classify all data and assets accordingly and apply handling procedures based on classification level.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-02 (*Data & Asset Classification*)  

---

## 5. Media Access

Access to media containing sensitive or regulated data must be restricted to authorized personnel. Logging and monitoring must be enabled for access to removable or high-risk storage.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-03 (*Media Access*)  

---

## 6. Media Marking

Subsidiaries must ensure that physical and digital media containing sensitive data are clearly marked according to classification level. Automated marking tools must be used where available.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-04 (*Media Marking*)  

---

## 7. Media Storage

Sensitive media must be stored in secure environments with physical or logical protections. Encryption, locked storage, and access monitoring must be applied to protect sensitive or regulated information at rest.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-06 (*Media Storage*)  

---

## 8. Media Transportation

Sensitive media must be encrypted and transported only by authorized custodians. Appropriate chain-of-custody records must be maintained.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-07 (*Media Transportation*)  

---

## 9. Physical Media Disposal

Physical media must be disposed of securely to prevent unauthorized recovery of sensitive data. Approved methods include shredding, degaussing, or incineration by trusted vendors.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-08 (*Physical Media Disposal*)  

---

## 10. System Media Sanitization

Before reuse or disposal, system media must be sanitized using approved methods to ensure sensitive data cannot be recovered. Documentation must be retained for sanitization activities.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-09 (*System Media Sanitization*)  

---

## 11. Removable Media Security

The use of removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) must be restricted and approved. Where use is necessary, removable media must be encrypted, inventoried, and periodically reviewed.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-12 (*Removable Media Security*)  

---

## 12. Use of External Information Systems

Subsidiaries must restrict and control the use of external information systems for processing or storing STH data. If external systems are authorized, they must comply with enterprise security requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-13 (*Use of External Information Systems*)  

---

## 13. Media & Data Retention

Subsidiaries must retain data only for as long as required by legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. Retention policies must minimize storage of sensitive or regulated data beyond business necessity.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-18 (*Media & Data Retention*)  

---

## 14. Information Disposal

Data must be securely disposed of when it is no longer required. This applies to both electronic and physical formats. Disposal must be irreversible and performed in alignment with regulatory and contractual requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** DCH-21 (*Information Disposal*)  

---

## 15. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of classification labels, storage controls, transport logs, retention schedules, and disposal certificates.  
- STH will periodically review subsidiary practices for compliance with this policy.  
- Deficiencies must be remediated in a timely manner.  

---

## 16. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract suspension, or legal action depending on severity. Unauthorized handling or disclosure of sensitive data is strictly prohibited.
