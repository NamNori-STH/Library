## 1. Purpose

Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) is committed to protecting its facilities, systems, and sensitive information through strong physical and environmental security measures. These safeguards are critical to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of enterprise and subsidiary information assets. This policy establishes baseline requirements that subsidiaries must align with to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or environmental disruption.  

---

## 2. Applicability

This policy applies to all STH facilities, subsidiaries, and data centers, whether owned, leased, or managed by third parties, where sensitive or regulated data is stored, processed, or transmitted. It applies to employees, contractors, vendors, and visitors who may require physical access to facilities.  

---

## 3. Physical & Environmental Protections

Subsidiaries must implement physical and environmental protections appropriate to the criticality of their systems and facilities. Protections may include perimeter defenses, security guards, barriers, and environmental controls such as fire suppression, HVAC redundancy, and power backup systems.  

- **SCF Mapping:** PES-01 (*Physical & Environmental Protections*)  

---

## 4. Physical Access Authorizations

Physical access to facilities and data centers must be formally authorized. Subsidiaries must maintain role-based access lists, ensuring only personnel with a legitimate business need are granted entry. Dual authorization must be required for highly sensitive areas where critical systems or regulated data are stored.  

- **SCF Mapping:** PES-02 (*Physical Access Authorizations*)  

---

## 5. Physical Access Control

Subsidiaries must enforce strict physical access controls, including the use of electronic badging, mantraps, or lockable physical casings where appropriate. Controlled ingress and egress points must be established, and all access must be logged and reviewed.  

- **SCF Mapping:** PES-03 (*Physical Access Control*)  

---

## 6. Monitoring Physical Access

Facilities must be equipped with monitoring systems, including cameras, alarms, and other surveillance equipment. Monitoring must provide coverage for entry/exit points and sensitive areas. Access logs and surveillance records must be retained in accordance with enterprise record retention requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** PES-05 (*Monitoring Physical Access*)  

---

## 7. Visitor Control

Subsidiaries must implement visitor control measures to distinguish visitors from employees and contractors. Visitors must be registered, wear visible identification, and be escorted at all times when in sensitive areas. Visitor records must be logged and reviewed, and access must be revoked promptly after visits are complete.  

- **SCF Mapping:** PES-06 (*Visitor Control*)  

---

## 8. Compliance & Governance

- Subsidiaries must maintain evidence of access authorizations, surveillance system configurations, visitor logs, and physical security reviews.  
- STH reserves the right to inspect subsidiary facilities or request third-party assessments.  
- Non-compliance must be remediated promptly, with unresolved issues escalated to executive management.  

---

## 9. Enforcement

Failure to comply with this policy may result in loss of facility access, disciplinary action, termination of employment or contracts, and potential legal action.
