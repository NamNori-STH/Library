## 1. Purpose

This Standard defines how Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) implements its Security Awareness & Training Policy by maintaining a structured, consistent training program that fosters a culture of cybersecurity and data privacy awareness across the organization. The objective is to ensure all personnel understand their responsibilities in protecting company assets, sensitive data, and systems.  

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to all STH employees, contractors, and third-party personnel, as well as to staff within subsidiaries such as FrontRunnerHC and LabXChange. Training is developed, administered, and tracked centrally by STH to ensure consistency in content, messaging, and compliance. Subsidiaries are responsible for ensuring that their personnel complete all required training as directed by STH.

## 3. Cybersecurity & Data Privacy-Minded Workforce

STH promotes a security-conscious culture by embedding cybersecurity and data privacy awareness into everyday business practices. All personnel must recognize that protecting sensitive information is a shared responsibility. To reinforce this, STH’s training content emphasizes real-world threat scenarios, such as phishing and social engineering, and encourages employees to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities promptly. The CIO oversees the enterprise awareness program, ensuring that it remains relevant and aligned with evolving risks.

## 4. Awareness Training

All personnel must complete general cybersecurity and data privacy awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training covers key topics such as secure data handling, password management, physical security, phishing detection, and acceptable use of corporate resources. Additional awareness materials—such as email campaigns, posters, and simulated phishing exercises—are distributed periodically to reinforce learning.

## 5. Role-Based Training

Certain personnel, such as software developers, administrators, and compliance or legal staff, receive specialized training based on their job functions. Role-based training provides deeper coverage of topics such as secure coding practices, incident response coordination, regulatory reporting, and data classification handling. The CIO determines which roles require enhanced training and ensures curricula are reviewed and updated regularly to match operational responsibilities and system changes.

## 6. Training Records

STH maintains centralized records of all security and privacy training activities, including participant rosters, completion dates, and the specific modules or courses completed. These records demonstrate compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements and support external audits, internal reviews, and SOC 2 evaluations. Training records are securely stored in the enterprise learning management system and retained in accordance with STH’s data retention schedule.

## 7. Governance & Oversight

The CIO is responsible for the oversight and management of the enterprise awareness and training program. STH reviews training metrics to verify participation and identify gaps. Subsidiary leadership must enforce compliance with training requirements and escalate instances of non-completion or repeated failures to STH for further action. The effectiveness of the awareness program is evaluated through periodic testing and employee feedback surveys.  

---

## 8. Enforcement

Failure to complete assigned training or to adhere to secure behavior expectations may result in disciplinary action, including temporary suspension of system access or termination of employment or contracts. Subsidiary management is responsible for ensuring corrective action is taken for personnel found non-compliant with STH’s training requirements.
