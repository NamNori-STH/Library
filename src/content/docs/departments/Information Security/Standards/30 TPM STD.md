**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Third Party Management (TPM)

## 1. Purpose

This Standard defines how Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) implements and enforces its Third Party Management Policy. It describes the procedures for onboarding, assessing, monitoring, and terminating third-party vendors that support STH and its subsidiaries. By managing vendor relationships centrally, STH ensures that all third parties adhere to consistent data protection and security requirements, mitigating enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to all third parties that provide products or services to Summit Technology Holdings or its subsidiaries. Vendors are considered in scope if they are critical to business operations, have access to sensitive or regulated data (including ePHI), or possess physical or remote access to internal systems and networks. Subsidiaries must not manage or contract directly with vendors unless authorized by STH executive leadership.

---

## 3. Vendor Inventory & Classification

STH maintains a centralized inventory of all vendors engaged by the organization or its subsidiaries. Each vendor is classified according to its criticality and access level—critical vendors, data-handling vendors, and system/network-access vendors receive heightened scrutiny. The vendor inventory is reviewed to ensure accuracy and completeness. Subsidiaries must notify STH of any new vendor requirements so the vendor can be properly classified and included in the centralized register.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-01 (*Inventory of Third Parties*)

---

## 4. Vendor Risk Assessments

STH conducts security and risk assessments for all vendors that meet the applicability criteria before any contract is executed. The assessment evaluates the vendor’s information security practices, data protection capabilities, and compliance posture against relevant frameworks such as HIPAA and SOC 2. For high-risk vendors, STH may request evidence such as SOC 2 Type II reports, HIPAA attestations, penetration testing summaries, or security questionnaires. Risk assessments are repeated periodically based on vendor classification, or upon significant changes to service scope or ownership.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-02 (*Third Party Risk Assessments*)

---

## 5. Contractual Requirements

All vendor contracts, including Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), are negotiated, reviewed, and executed by STH. Each contract must contain data protection provisions appropriate to the sensitivity of the information shared, including confidentiality clauses, incident notification obligations, right-to-audit provisions, and data return or destruction terms. Subsidiaries are prohibited from executing independent contracts or amending existing vendor agreements without STH approval.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-04 (*Third Party Contracts*)

---

## 6. Monitoring & Oversight

STH maintains ongoing oversight of all vendors through periodic monitoring and reassessment. All third-party vendors must be evaluated and classified based on the potential risk they pose to the organization. This classification considers the vendor’s access to systems, networks, and data—especially ePHI—and the criticality of their services to business operations. The classification determines the depth of due diligence, as well as the frequency and scope of ongoing reviews.

STH uses a **three-tier vendor classification model** to ensure proportionate oversight based on the level of exposure and importance to business operations:

- **High-Risk Vendors** are those with access to ePHI, internal systems, or services deemed business critical. These vendors undergo comprehensive assessments that evaluate their policies, procedures, technical safeguards, and infrastructure.
- **Medium-Risk Vendors** have limited access to sensitive data or systems. These vendors receive targeted assessments focused on specific areas of exposure and their role in the environment.
- **Low-Risk Vendors** have no access to sensitive data or systems and pose minimal operational impact. Examples include janitorial or facility maintenance providers.

All vendors are reassessed **annually** to confirm their classification and ensure appropriate oversight remains in place. The results of these reviews are documented and retained within the enterprise vendor management system.  

STH’s Security and Compliance teams are responsible for coordinating monitoring activities, reviewing evidence, and documenting outcomes. Subsidiaries must escalate any vendor performance, compliance, or security concerns to STH for centralized review and remediation.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-05 (*Third Party Monitoring*)

---

## 7. Termination of Vendor Relationships

When a vendor relationship ends, STH ensures that all logical and physical access to company and subsidiary systems is revoked. Vendors are required to return or securely destroy any STH or subsidiary data and to certify completion of these actions in writing. Termination procedures are documented, reviewed, and retained by STH as part of vendor lifecycle management records. Subsidiaries must not manage vendor disengagements independently, but instead coordinate with STH to confirm proper closure.  

- **SCF Mapping:** TPM-08 (*Termination of Third Party Relationships*)

---

## 8. Subsidiary Participation

Subsidiaries are required to participate in the STH vendor management process by submitting new vendor requests through STH’s procurement and compliance workflow. Each request must include a justification for the service, data classification impact, and operational need. Subsidiaries must cooperate fully with STH-led assessments and monitoring activities and must not engage any vendor outside the enterprise process without explicit written approval from the CIO or legal counsel.

---

## 9. Governance & Oversight

The CIO is responsible for oversight of the enterprise vendor management program, supported by Legal Counsel for contract review and by the Security and Compliance teams for ongoing monitoring. STH maintains complete documentation of vendor inventories, risk assessments, contracts, and monitoring results. Periodic internal reviews are performed to verify program effectiveness, identify gaps, and ensure regulatory alignment. Non-compliance or deviations from this Standard will be escalated to executive leadership for corrective action.

---

## 10. Enforcement

Violations of this Standard, including failure to comply with vendor management processes or unauthorized vendor engagements, may result in disciplinary action, termination of contracts, or legal proceedings. STH reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate vendor access to systems and data when security or compliance risks are identified.
