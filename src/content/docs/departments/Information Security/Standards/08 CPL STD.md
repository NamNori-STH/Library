title: Compliance Standard

**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Compliance (CPL)

**Parent Policy Reference:**

- [Summit Technology Holdings – Compliance Policy](departments/information-security/policies/08-cpl/)

---

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines how **STH centrally operates the enterprise compliance program** to meet statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations. It translates the STH Compliance Policy into specific processes for obligations tracking, control oversight, and assessments. Subsidiaries (e.g., FRHC and LX) **support** the program by supplying evidence and implementing STH directives but do not run independent compliance programs.

---

## 2. Applicability

This standard applies to all STH corporate functions and to all subsidiaries **in a supporting capacity**. It covers obligations related to HIPAA, SOC 2, customer/security addenda, and any other contractual or regulatory requirements applicable to STH and its subsidiaries.

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

The **Chief Information Officer (CIO)** of Summit Technology Holdings is responsible for managing the compliance program, including statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations, as well as enterprise information security programs. The CIO owns the obligations register, compliance calendar, evidence repository, assessments, issue management, and reporting.  

Legal Counsel supports the CIO by interpreting regulatory requirements and serving as the designated Chief Privacy Officer (CPO). Subsidiaries assign **local points of contact** to provide artifacts and implement remediation under the CIO’s direction.

## 4. Statutory, Regulatory & Contractual Compliance (How STH Manages Obligations)

STH maintains a **central obligations register** cataloging all applicable laws, regulations, frameworks, and contractual security/privacy clauses. Each entry records scope, authoritative source, applicability (enterprise vs. subsidiary), required controls, evidence expectations, review cadence, and the STH control owner. The register is reviewed at least **quarterly** and whenever triggers occur (new customer contracts, regulatory updates, material system changes, incidents). Legal provides interpretation; Security maps to control requirements; Procurement routes new contracts to the CCO before signature to capture obligations up front.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-01 (*Statutory, Regulatory & Contractual Compliance*)

---

## 5. Cybersecurity & Data Protection Controls Oversight (How STH Governs Controls)

STH maintains an **enterprise control catalogue** aligned to the SCF and mapped to each obligation in the register. For every control, STH defines: objective, implementation expectations, **evidence required**, responsible parties (STH owner and subsidiary implementers), and review cadence. STH publishes enterprise **policies/standards** and sets minimum baselines (e.g., MFA for all accounts, encryption, logging). Subsidiaries implement locally (cloud/provider/tool specifics) and **submit evidence to STH’s central repository** by the due dates on the compliance calendar. STH performs control health checks, requests corrective action plans (CAPs) where gaps exist, tracks remediation to closure, and validates fixes.

---

## 6. Cybersecurity & Data Protection Assessments (How STH Tests & Assures)

STH runs a **risk-based assessment program** that includes: periodic internal control testing, readiness activities for external audits (e.g., SOC 2), HIPAA evaluations, and targeted reviews after material changes or incidents. Assessment scopes derive from the obligations register and risk profile. STH may use independent assessors where appropriate. Findings are logged centrally with severity, owner, due date, and required evidence of closure; retesting verifies effectiveness. STH coordinates all **customer and third-party assessments**, providing standardized responses and evidence packages and limiting subsidiary interactions to curated, need-to-know artifacts.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-03 (*Cybersecurity & Data Protection Assessments*)

---

## 7. Compliance Calendar & Evidence Management

STH maintains a **compliance calendar** with recurring activities (policy reviews, access reviews, key rotations, training attestations, vulnerability governance checkpoints, audit windows). Evidence is stored in an **STH-managed repository** with versioning and retention. Each control has a defined **evidence of record** (e.g., configuration exports, screenshots with timestamps, attestation forms, system reports), and STH validates completeness and freshness before use in audits.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-02, CPL-03

---

## 8. Exceptions, Issues & Corrective Actions

Where a requirement cannot be met, STH manages a documented **exception process** that records justification, compensating controls, risk acceptance level, approver, and expiration date. Control **deficiencies** identified via oversight or assessments require a **Corrective Action Plan (CAP)** with owner, milestones, and evidence of completion. STH tracks and escalates overdue items to executive leadership.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-02, CPL-03

---

## 9. Reporting & Governance

STH delivers periodic compliance status reports and risk summaries to executive leadership and the governing body. Reports include obligation coverage, control efficacy, open exceptions, audit outcomes, and remediation progress. Material issues, potential non-compliance, or customer-impacting risks are **escalated immediately** per STH governance protocols.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-02, CPL-03

---

## 10. Subsidiary Support Requirements

Subsidiaries must: (1) designate a compliance point of contact; (2) implement STH-mandated controls/standards; (3) **produce evidence** on STH timelines; (4) execute remediation as directed; and (5) notify STH of system or contractual changes that may affect obligations. Subsidiaries **do not** maintain separate compliance programs or negotiate compliance positions independently.

- **SCF Mapping:** CPL-01, CPL-02, CPL-03

---

## 11. Enforcement

Failure to supply timely, accurate evidence, implement required controls, or complete remediation may result in escalation, access restrictions, or contractual/disciplinary actions. STH may impose interim risk treatments when compliance gaps present material risk.
