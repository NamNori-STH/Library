title: Human Resources Security Standard
---

**Organization:** Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH)  
**Parent Policy Reference:** [Summit Technology Holdings – Human Resources Security Policy](https://library.summittechnology.com/Information-Security/Policies/HumanResourcesSecurity)  
**Framework Reference:** Secure Controls Framework (SCF) – Human Resources Security (HRS)

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard defines how Summit Technology Holdings, LLC (STH) implements its Human Resources Security Policy by ensuring that all personnel—employees, contractors, and other workers—understand and fulfill their responsibilities in protecting company assets and sensitive information. It outlines the enterprise’s approach to personnel screening, role management, onboarding, and separation, ensuring that human resource activities are aligned with STH’s information security and compliance objectives.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to all individuals employed or contracted by Summit Technology Holdings and its subsidiaries, including FrontRunnerHC (FRHC) and LabXChange (LX). Because human resource functions are centrally managed at STH, this Standard governs all HR security practices throughout the organization, from hiring and onboarding through transfer, termination, and post-employment obligations. Subsidiaries must follow this Standard in coordination with STH Human Resources and the Chief Information Officer (CIO), who oversees compliance and governance.

---

## 3. Human Resources Security Management

STH maintains a centralized Human Resources Security Management program to ensure that personnel practices support the organization’s broader information security framework. The CIO is accountable for ensuring that HR policies, hiring procedures, and disciplinary actions are consistent with STH’s security requirements and applicable laws. Human Resources, Legal, and IT coordinate to align policies, document responsibilities, and maintain accurate records of compliance-related activities.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-01 (*Human Resources Security Management*)

---

## 4. Position Categorization

Each position within the organization is classified according to the level of information access and sensitivity associated with its duties. STH Human Resources maintains an inventory of positions with elevated or privileged access, ensuring that job descriptions and approvals reflect these distinctions. This approach enables STH to apply appropriate controls, such as enhanced screening and role-based access, to safeguard critical systems and sensitive data.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-02 (*Position Categorization*)

---

## 5. Defined Roles & Responsibilities

All employees and contractors are assigned defined roles and responsibilities that include security and compliance expectations appropriate to their duties. Security-related responsibilities are documented in job descriptions and employment agreements, and employees are required to acknowledge their understanding of these requirements during onboarding. The CIO and HR periodically review job functions to ensure duties remain consistent with the principle of least privilege and that separation of responsibilities is maintained.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-03 (*Defined Roles & Responsibilities*)

---

## 6. Personnel Screening

Prior to hiring or engagement, STH performs background screening appropriate to the position’s sensitivity and access level. Screening may include verification of employment history, education, references, and criminal background checks, as permitted by law. STH ensures that screening is completed and documented before access to any sensitive systems or data is granted. Employees transitioning to higher-risk roles are subject to rescreening, and all screening records are retained securely in accordance with privacy and retention requirements.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-04 (*Personnel Screening*)

---

## 7. Terms of Employment

All employees and contractors must sign formal employment or engagement agreements that include confidentiality, acceptable use, and conduct clauses. These agreements explicitly reference compliance with STH policies, including information security, data protection, and acceptable use requirements. Employees are required to acknowledge updates to these policies as they are revised, and failure to comply may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-05 (*Terms of Employment*)

---

## 8. Access Agreements

Personnel with access to sensitive systems or data must sign access and confidentiality agreements as part of their onboarding process. These agreements outline obligations for proper handling, disclosure, and safeguarding of information, both during and after employment. Access agreements are stored in personnel files and reviewed upon changes to employment status or access privileges.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-06 (*Access Agreements*)

---

## 9. Personnel Sanctions

STH enforces consistent disciplinary measures for violations of policies, standards, or other compliance requirements. The HR and Legal departments jointly manage the disciplinary process to ensure fairness and documentation. Sanctions may include verbal or written warnings, suspension, or termination, depending on severity. All actions are documented and retained as part of the employee’s HR record.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-07 (*Personnel Sanctions*)

---

## 10. Personnel Transfer

When personnel transfer between roles, departments, or subsidiaries, HR and IT review all access rights to ensure they remain appropriate for the new position. Access no longer required must be promptly revoked, and new permissions must be provisioned according to the least privilege principle. HR updates records to reflect the change, and supervisors verify that no residual access remains.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-08 (*Personnel Transfer*)

---

## 11. Personnel Termination

Upon termination, whether voluntary or involuntary, HR coordinates with IT to ensure all logical and physical access is revoked immediately. Company-owned equipment, credentials, and identification must be returned prior to the employee’s final day. Exit interviews are conducted to remind departing employees of ongoing confidentiality obligations. For high-risk separations, additional security controls may be implemented at the discretion of the CIO.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-09 (*Personnel Termination*)

---

## 12. Separation of Duties

STH enforces separation of duties to prevent conflicts of interest and reduce the potential for fraud or misuse of access privileges. No individual may control all phases of a critical process, and privileged functions are divided among multiple roles wherever feasible. The CIO and HR periodically review access assignments to ensure segregation of duties is maintained.  

- **SCF Mapping:** HRS-11 (*Separation of Duties (SoD)*)

---

## 13. Governance & Oversight

The CIO is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this Standard across all STH subsidiaries. Records relating to background screening, transfers, terminations, and sanctions are retained securely and made available for internal review or external audit upon request.

---

## 14. Enforcement

Failure to comply with this Standard, including unauthorized access, failure to follow screening procedures, or violation of confidentiality agreements, may result in disciplinary action, termination, or legal proceedings.
